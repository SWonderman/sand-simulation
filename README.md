# Simple Sand Simulation
Simple sand simulation written in Go using raylib. The goal of the project was to understand the general concept of transferring real-life materials/elements into a 2D grid world and making it possible for materials to interact and influence each other.

The simulation offers three elements - sand, stone, and water. It is possible to dynamically change elements by pressing `1`, `2`, and `3` keyboard keys to switch between sand, stone, and water, respectively. It is also possible to remove elements by pressing `4` and right-clicking/dragging on areas that should be removed.

The whole screen can be cleared completely by clicking `q`.

The simulation was inspired by the [Exploring the Tech and Design of Noita](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prXuyMCgbTc&t=992s) talk from GDC 2019.
